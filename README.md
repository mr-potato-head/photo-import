# photo-import
Bash script for importing photographs from SD card.

The script takes two parameters
- the first one is the source folder (SD card for example)
- the second one is the destination folder (root of the tree).

The script creates a year/month/day tree from photograph dates.

It uses Exiftool to get photograph informations. Please install it before using this script.
